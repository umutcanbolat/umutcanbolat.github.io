## Hey there!

Iâ€™m Umut, a software engineer from [Giessen, Germany](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gie%C3%9Fen/@50.6918387,9.6675483,7z). I work at [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/) and try to move digital payments one step further every day.

I know the importance of highly readable, clean, and easily maintainable code. I enjoy learning new technologies to create software solutions with the user in mind.

The mindset behind this blog is to help my past self on the topics that I wished there were clear explanations for. This will hopefully make it much easier for the people who got stuck on the same topics.

Want to join forces? Check out my **[resume](https://www.umutcanbolat.com/resume)** and tell me about your next project idea.
