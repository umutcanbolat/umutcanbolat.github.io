## Hey there!

Iâ€™m Umut, a software engineer living in [Berlin](https://goo.gl/maps/81k98xigP3Fuu7tX7) and working at [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/). I try to move digital payments one step further every day.

I know the importance of highly readable, clean, and easily maintainable code. I enjoy learning new technologies to create software solutions with the user in mind.

The mindset behind this blog is to help my past self on the topics that I wished there were clear explanations for. This will hopefully make it much easier for the people who got stuck on the same topics.

Want to join forces? Check out my **[resume](https://www.umutcanbolat.com/resume)** and tell me about your next project idea.
