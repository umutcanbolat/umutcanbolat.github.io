## Hey there!

I'm Umut, a software engineer from Giessen, Germany. I work at Klarna and try to move digital payments one step further every day.

I know the importance of highly readable, clean and easily maintainable code. I enjoy learning new technologies to create software with the user in mind.

This blog is like a scribble book that I take some notes in. Generally, the summary of topics I encounter when I do my hobby projects or during work.

The idea behind this blog is to help myself find information when I need them again and help other people when they got stuck on the same stuff. I will also share some of my experiences here.

PS: All the posts are experimental :)
